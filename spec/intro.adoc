SoC designs employ application-specific hardware accelerators to improve
performance and reduce energy use -- particularly so with FPGA SoCs
that offer both plasticity and abundant spatial parallelism. The
RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) anticipates this and
invites domain-specific custom instructions within the base ISA
cite:[risc-v-unpriv(5)].

There are many RISC-V processors with custom instruction extensions,
and now some vendor tooling for creating them. But the software libraries
that use these extensions and the cores that implement them are authored
by different organizations, using different tools, and might not work
together side-by-side in a new system. Different custom extensions
may conflict in use of opcodes, or their implementations may require
different CPU cores, pipeline structures, logic interfaces, models of
computation, means of discovery, or error reporting regimes. Composition
is difficult, impairing reuse of hardware and software, and fragmenting
the RISC-V ecosystem.

The RISC-V Composable Custom Extensions Specification introduces a
set of hardware-hardware and hardware-software interfaces and metadata
designed to make it easy to create, compose, reuse, version, program,
and deploy systems with multiple custom extensions and their libraries,
enabling an open ecosystem, and marketplace, of custom extensions'
hardware and software.

=== Open, agile, interoperable, unfettered instruction set innovation

RISC-V International uses a community process to define a new optional
standard extension to the RISC-V instruction set architecture. Candidate
extensions must be of broad interest and general utility to justify
the permanent allocation of precious RISC-V opcode space, CSR space,
and more generally to add to the enduring, essential complexity of the
RISC-V platform. New standard extensions typically require months or
years to reach consensus and ratification.

In contrast, the interfaces defined in this specification allow anyone,
whether individual, organization, or consortium, to rapidly define,
develop, and use:

* a _custom interface (CI):_ a composable custom extension consisting of a set of _custom function (CF) instructions;_
* a _custom function unit (CFU):_ a composable hardware core that implements a custom interface;
* an accelerated _custom interface library_ that issues custom functions of custom interfaces;
* a processor that can use any CFU;
* tools to create or consume these elements; and
* to compose these arbitrarily into a system of hardware accelerated software libraries.

There need be _no central authority_, no lock in, no lock out, and no
asking for permission. Custom interfaces, their CFUs and libraries,
may be open or proprietary, of broad or narrow interest. A new processor
can use existing CFUs and CI libraries. A new custom interface, CFU, and
library can be used by existing CPUs and systems. Many CFUs may implement
a given custom interface, and many libraries may use a custom interface.

Such open composition requires routine, robust integration of separately
authored, separately versioned elements into stable systems that _just
work_ so that if the various hardware and software elements correctly
work separately, they correctly work together, and so that if a composed
system works correctly today, it continues to work, even as interfaces
and implementations evolve across years and decades.

Such unbridled composition requires an unlimited number of independently
developed custom interfaces to coexist within a fixed ABI and ISA. This
is achieved with _custom interface multiplexing_, described below.

//[NOTE]
//====
//Consider global renaming: custom interface to custom extension (CX);
//custom interface library to CX library; and CFU to CXU. Then we would
//have _CX libs target CXs_ and _CXUs implement CXs_.
//====

=== Examples

Alice develops a multicore RISC-V-based FPGA SmartNIC application
processor subsystem. The software stack includes processes that already
use a cryptography CI library that issues custom instructions, of a
cryptography custom interface, that execute on a cryptography custom
function unit.

Profiling reveals a compute bottleneck in file block data
compression. Fortunately, the compression library can use a
hardware-accelerated compression custom interface, if present in the
system. Alice obtains a compression CFU package that implements the
interface, adds it to the MPSoC system manifest, configures its parameter
settings, then re-composes and rebuilds the FPGA design. The cryptography
CFU, compression CFU, CFU interconnect, and CPU cores all use the same
_CFU Logic Interface_, so this incurs no RTL coding. The _system CFU map_
(a new part of the device tree) is updated to map from the compression
_custom interface ID (CI_ID)_ (a 128-bit GUID) to the compression unit
_CFU_ID._

The compression library calls the CI Runtime to discover if compression
acceleration is available. The runtime consults the CFU map for that
CI_ID, finding the compression CFU_ID. Next the library uses the CI
Runtime to _select_ the compression interface, and its CFU, prior to
issuing compression instructions to this CFU. Later the cryptography
library uses the same CI Runtime API to discover and select the
cryptography interface prior to issuing cryptography instructions to
the cryptography CFU.

Later, Bob takes Alice's system and adds an ML inference library. For
acceleration, Bob defines a new binary neural network custom interface,
`bnn_ci`, identified with a new CI_ID he mints. Bob's new BNN custom
instructions reuse standard custom instruction encodings, which is fine
because they're scoped to `bnn_ci`. Bob develops `bobs_bnn_cfu` core, and CFU
metadata that describes it. He adds that package to the system manifest
and rebuilds the system, updating the CFU map. Bob's system now runs
highly accelerated with cryptography, compression, and inference custom
function instructions issuing from the various CPU cores and executing
in the various CFUs.

[[composed-system]]

<<composed-system>> illustrates this.
A _Composer_ tool assembles and configures the reusable, composable CPU
and CFU RTL packages into a complete system, per the system manifest,
and generates a devicetree (or similar) that determines the system CFU
map. Each acclerated library uses the Runtime to select its respective
custom iterface, and its CFU, prior to issuing custom function
instructions of that interface to that CFU.

=== Scope: reliable composition via strict isolation

To ensure that composition of custom interfaces and their CFUs does
not subtly change the behavior of any interface, each must operate in
isolation. Therefore, each custom function (CF) instruction is of limited
scope: exclusively computing an ALU-like integer function of up to two
operands (integer register(s) and/or immediate value), with read/write
access to the interface's private state (if any), writing the result to
a destination register.

A CF may not access other resources, such as floating-point registers
or vector registers, pending definition of suitable custom instruction
formats.

A CF may not access _isolation-problematic_ shared resources such as
memory, CSRs, the program counter, the instruction stream, exceptions,
or interrupts, pending a means to ensure correct composition by
design. (Except that, as with RISC-V floating point extensions, the
default error model accumulates CFU errors in a shared CFU status CSR.)

==== Stateless and stateful custom interfaces

A custom interface may be stateless or stateful. For a stateless
interface, each CF is a pure function of its operands, whereas a stateful
interface has one or more isolated state contexts, and each CF may access,
and as a side effect, update, the hart's _current_ state context of the
interface (only).

Isolated state means that latency notwithstanding, 1) the behavior of
the interface only depends upon the series of CF requests issued on that
interface and never upon on any other operation of the system; and 2)
besides updating interface state, the CFU status CSR, and a destination
register, issuing a CF has no effect upon any other architected state or
behavior of the system. Issuing a CF instruction may update the current
state context of the custom interface but has no effect upon another
state context of that interface, nor that of any other interface.

A CFU implementing a stateful custom interface is typically provisioned
with one state context per hart, but other configurations, including
one context per request, activity, fiber, task, or thread, or a small
pool of shared contexts, or several harts sharing one context, or one
singleton context, are also possible. Similarly, each CFU in a system
may be configured with a different number of its state contexts.

A <<serializable,_serializable_>> stateful custom interface
supports interface-agnostic context management.

[TIP]
====
Although custom intefaces never introduce nor use CSRs, the same effect
can be obtained via custom functions that read or write facets of the
interface state context.
====

=== Standard interfaces and formats

To facilitate an open ecosystem of composable custom interfaces, CFUs,
libraries, and tools, the specification defines common interop interfaces
and formats:

* the _CFU Logic Interface (CFU-LI),_
* the _Custom Interface Hardware-Software Interface (CI-ABI), including CFU-extensions to RV-I (-Zicfu)_,
* the _Custom Interface Runtime API (CI-RT)_, and
* build-time _CFU Metadata (CFU-MD)._

The hardware-software interfaces stack (<<layers>>) shows how these
interfaces and formats work together to compose user-defined custom
interfaces CI~0~ and CI~1~, their libraries, and their CFUs into a system.

==== CFU Logic Interface (CFU-LI)

The CFU-LI defines the hardware-to-hardware logic interface between a
_CFU requester_ (e.g., a CPU) and a _CFU responder_ (e.g., a CFU). When
a custom function instruction issues, the CPU sends a _CFU request_,
providing the request's _CFU identifier (<<CFU_ID,CFU_ID>>)_, the _custom function
identifier (<<CF_ID,CF_ID>>), _state index (<<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>>)_, if any, and request data
(operands). The CFU performs the custom function then sends a _CFU
response_ providing response data and error status.

In a system with multiple CPUs and/or CFUs, mux and adapter CFUs
accept and route requests to CFUs and accept and route responses back
to CPUs. The CFU-LI supports CPUs and CFUs of various _feature levels_
of capability and complexity, including combinational CFUs, fixed-latency
CFUs, and variable latency CFUs with flow control.

[[intro-CSRs]]
==== CFU hardware-software interface

The CFU hardware-software interface, -Zicfu, repurposes three custom
function instruction formats and adds four CSRs. The three instruction
formats reuse the _custom-0_, _custom-1_, and _custom-2_ formats /
major opcodes
cite:[risc-v-unpriv(143)]
but (via custom interface multiplexing) compose correctly with any
preexisting vendor-defined CPU-specific custom extensions and their
custom instructions. The four new CFU CSRs are:

* `mcfu_selector`: selects the hart's current <<CFU_ID,CFU_ID>> and <<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>>, for custom interface multiplexing;
* `cfu_status`: accumulates CFU errors;
* `mcfu_selector_table`, `cfu_selector_index`: efficient access control to CFUs and CFU state.

[NOTE]
====
`mcfu_selector_table` is insufficient given various M/H/S/U privilege
levels. This corner of the design requires additional work, and additional
CSRs.
====

[[Intro-CIM]]
==== Custom interface multiplexing

Custom interface multiplexing provides an inexhaustible collision-free
opcode space for CF instructions for diverse custom interfaces without
resort to any _central assigned opcodes authority_, and thereby
facilitates direct reuse of CI library binaries.

A custom-interface-aware library, prior to issuing a CF instruction,
must first CSR-write a _system and hart specific_ CI selector value to
`mcfu_selector`, routing subsequently issued CF instructions on this
hart to its CFU and to a specific state context. Like the -V vector
extension's `vsetvl` instructions, a CSR-write to `mcfu_selector` is a
prefix that modifies the behavior of CF instructions that follow. With
each CF instruction issued, the CPU sends a CFU request to the hart's
current CFU and its current state. This request is routed by standard
Mux CFU and adapter cores to the hart's _current_ CFU, which performs
the custom function using the hart's current state context. Its response
is routed back to the CPU which writes the destination register and
updates `cfu_status`.

The `mcfu_selector` CI selector value, a tuple (<<CFU_ID,CFU_ID>>,
<<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>>), is system specific because different systems may
be configured with different sets of CFUs, with different CFU_ID mappings,
and is hart specific because different harts may use different isolated
state contexts. Raw CI selector values are not typically compiled into
software binaries.

In a system with multiple CI libraries that invoke CF instructions
on different interfaces, each library uses the CI Runtime to look up
selectors for a CI_ID and update `mcfu_selector`, routing CF instructions
to its interface's CFU and state context. Over time, across library calls,
`mcfu_selector` is written again and again.

[TIP]
====
Reuse of custom instruction encodings across interfaces will make
debugging, esp. disassembly, more challenging.
====

==== `IStateContext` and serializable stateful custom interfaces

The specification defines a custom interface `IStateContext` with four
standard custom functions for serializable stateful custom interfaces:

[source,C++]
....
interface IStateContext {
//  CF_ID       custom function
    [1023] int  cf_read_status ();
    [1022] void cf_write_status(int status);
    [1021] int  cf_read_state  (int index);
    [1020] void cf_write_state (int index, int state);
};
....

The CFU status indicates cumulative error flags, clean/dirty, and state
context size.  The read/write state functions access words of the state
context.

These standard custom functions enable an interface-aware CI library to
access stateful interface specific error status, and an interface-agnostic
runtime or operating system to reset, save, and reload state context(s).

==== CI Application Programming Interface and CI-ABI

The CI-API consists of the _CI Runtime_ API, and a calling convention
rule. Both are necessary for correct discovery, operation, and composition
of CI libraries. As described above (<<intro-CSRs>>) the current `mcfu_selector`
CSR selects the current custom interface/CFU and state context for the
hart. However, a CI library should not directly create a CI selector
value, nor directly access the CSR. Rather a CI library uses the CI
Runtime to look up the CI selector value for its custom interface's
CI_ID and to write it to `mcfu_selector`, prior to issuing CF
instructions. For example, using a C++ _RAII_ object ci to represent a
(scoped) custom interface selection:

[source,C++]
....
#include "ci.h"                         // CI Runtime: class use_ci { ... }
use_ci ci(my_bitmanip_ci_id);           // csrrw mcfu_selector
uint32_t count = cf(pcnt_cf, data, 0);  // cfu_reg cf_id, rd, rs1, rs2
....

The provisional CI-ABI defines a _callee-save_ calling convention for
`mcfu_selector`. For example, consider CI library functions `a()` and
`b()`, for interfaces `A` and `B`, that issue CF instructions `af0`,
`af1`, `bf0`, `bf1`, in this program:

[source,C++]
....
main() { a(); }
a() { use_ci a_ci(A_ci_id); af0; b(); @1 af1; }
b() { use_ci b_ci(B_ci_id); bf0; bf1; }
....

with execution trace:

[source,C++]
....
main() { a() { a_ci(); af0; b() { b_ci(); bf0; bf1; ~b_ci(); } @1 af1; ~a_ci(); }
....

With a callee-save discipline, at point `@1`, upon return from `b()`, the
current custom interface must be `A` again. Thus the `b_ci()` constructor
saves `a()'s` `mcfu_selector` value while overwriting it; later its
`~b_ci()` destructor restores it. This _RAII_ approach also correctly restores
`mcfu_selector` in the event of an exception handling stack unwind.

=== System composition

==== Metadata and system manifest

To support automatic composition of CPUs and CFUs into working systems,
this specification defines a standard CFU metadata format that details
each core's properties, features, and configurable parameters, including
CFU-LI feature level, data widths, response latency (or variable),
and number of state contexts. Each CPU and CFU package, as well as the
system manifest, include a metadata file.

==== Composer

A system composer (human or tool) gathers the system manifest metadata and
the metadata of the manifest-specified CPUs and CFUs, then uses (manual
or automatic) constraint satisfaction to find feasible, optimal parameter
settings across these components. The composer may also configure or
generate mux and adapter CFUs to automatically interconnect the CPU and
the CFUs.

For example, a system composed from a CPU that supports two or three
cycle fixed latency CFUs, a CFU~1~ that supports response latency
of one or more cycles, a CFU~2~ that has a fixed response latency of
three cycles, and CFU~3~ which is combinational (zero cycles latency),
overall has a valid configuration with three cycles of CFU latency,
with the CPU coupled to a mux CFU, coupled to CFU~1~ and CFU~2~ and to
a _fixed latency adapter CFU_, coupled to CFU~3~.

==== Diversity of systems and operating systems

Composable custom interfaces and CFUs are designed for use across
a broad spectrum of RISC-V systems, from a simple RVI20U-Zicsr-Zicfu
microcontroller running bare metal fully trusted firmware, to a multicore
RVA20S Linux profile, running secure multi-programmed, multithreaded user
processes running various CI libraries, and with privileged hypervisors
and operating systems securely managing access control to CFUs and
CFU state.

=== Future directions, TODOs

The present specification focuses on composition at the hardware-software
interface, and below. Future work includes:

* Expand the scope of custom interfaces to include access to non-integer
registers, CSRs, and memory, while preserving composition.

* Expand the CFU Logic Interface to support greater computation
flexibility and speculative execution.

* Design and implement an automatic system composition tool.

arms-length composition of independently authored, independently versioned
software components, at scale, over decades
