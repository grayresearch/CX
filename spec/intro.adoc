SoC designs employ application-specific hardware accelerators to improve
performance and reduce energy use -- particularly so with FPGA SoCs
that offer both plasticity and abundant spatial parallelism. The
RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) anticipates this and
invites domain-specific custom instructions within the base ISA
cite:[risc-v-unpriv(5)].

There are many RISC-V processors with custom instruction extensions,
and vendor tooling for creating them. But the software libraries that
use these extensions and the cores that implement them are authored
by different organizations, using different tools, and might not work
together side-by-side in a new system. Different composable extensions
may conflict in use of custom opcodes, custom CSR addresses, or their
implementations may require different CPU cores, pipeline structures,
logic interfaces, models of computation, means of discovery, or error
reporting regimes. Composition is difficult, impairing reuse of hardware
and software, and fragmenting the RISC-V ecosystem: if you can't use
_this_ extension, you can't also use _that_ extension.

The RISC-V Composable Custom Extensions Specification defines an ISA
extension plus non-ISA interoperation interfaces (HW-HW and HW-SW) and
metadata, enabling a new, entirely optional, backwards compatible,
managed _subcategory_ of custom extensions, that make it easy and routine to
compose my composable extensions with yours, and others, without prior
coordination, and without recompiling our libraries or our operating system.

This enables robust reuse of anyone's composable extensions and libraries,
and provides a uniform programming model across all such extensions,
together enabling a marketplace of reusable extensions, libraries, and
hardware modules.

=== Open, agile, interoperable instruction set innovation

RISC-V International uses a community process to define a new optional
standard extension to the RISC-V instruction set architecture. Candidate
extensions must be of broad interest and general utility to justify
the permanent allocation of precious RISC-V opcode space, CSR space,
and more generally to add to the enduring, essential complexity of the
RISC-V platform. New standard extensions typically require months or
years to reach consensus and ratification.

In contrast, the extensions defined in this specification allow anyone,
whether individual, organization, or consortium, to rapidly define,
develop, and use:

* a _composable extension (CX):_ the _interface contract_ of a composable
custom extension consisting of a set of _custom function (CF) instructions_
and CX custom CSRs _(CX CSRs)_ and their behavior;

* a _composable extension unit (CXU):_ a composable hardware core that
implements a composable extension;

* a _composable extension library_ that issues custom functions of
composable extensions;

* a processor that can use any CXU;

* tools to create or consume these elements; and

* to compose these arbitrarily into a system of hardware accelerated
software libraries.

There need be _no central authority_, no lock in, no lock out, and no
asking for permission. Composable extensions, their CXUs and libraries,
may be open or proprietary, of broad or narrow interest. A new processor
can use existing CXUs and CX libraries. A new composable extension,
CXU, and library can be used by existing CPUs and systems. Many CXUs
may implement a given composable extension, and many libraries may use
a composable extension.

Such open composition requires routine, robust integration of separately
authored, separately versioned elements into stable systems that _just
work_ so that if the various hardware and software elements correctly
work separately, they correctly work together, and so that if a composed
system works correctly today, it continues to work, even as extensions
and implementations evolve across years and decades.

Composition also requires an unlimited number of independently developed
composable extensions to coexist within a fixed ABI and ISA. This is
achieved with <<multiplexing,_composable extension multiplexing_>>,
described below.

=== Examples

Alice develops a multicore RISC-V-based FPGA SmartNIC application
processor subsystem. The software stack includes processes that already
use a cryptography CX library that issues custom instructions, of
a cryptography composable extension, that execute on a cryptography
composable extension unit.

Profiling reveals a compute bottleneck in file block data
compression. Fortunately, the compression library can use a
hardware-accelerated compression composable extension, if present in the
system. Alice obtains a compression CXU package that implements the
extension, adds it to the MPSoC system manifest, configures its parameter
settings, then re-composes and rebuilds the FPGA design. The cryptography
CXU, compression CXU, CXU interconnect, and CPU cores all use the same
_CXU Logic Interface_, so this incurs no RTL coding. The _system CXU map_
(a new part of the device tree) is updated to map from the compression
_composable extension ID (CX_ID)_ (a 128-bit GUID) to the compression unit
_CXU_ID._

The compression library calls the CX Runtime to discover if compression
acceleration is available. The runtime consults the CXU map for that
CX_ID, finding the compression CXU_ID. Next the library uses the CX
Runtime to _select_ the compression extension, and its CXU, prior to
issuing compression instructions to this CXU. Later the cryptography
library uses the same CX Runtime API to discover and select the
cryptography extension prior to issuing cryptography instructions to
the cryptography CXU.

[[composed-system]]
.Bob's system, composed from CPU and CXU packages and composable extension libraries
image::composed-system.png[image,width="80%"]

Later, Bob takes Alice's system design, replaces the CPU cores with
different (but also CXU-compatible) cores, and adds an ML inference
library. For further acceleration, Bob defines a new binary neural
network inference composable extension, `IBNN`, identified with a new
CX_ID he mints. Bob's new BNN custom instructions reuse the standard
custom instruction encodings, which is fine because they're scoped to
`IBNN`. Bob develops `bobs_bnn_cxu` core, and CXU metadata that describes
it. He adds that package to the system manifest and rebuilds the system,
updating the CXU map. Bob's system now runs highly accelerated with
cryptography, compression, and inference custom function instructions
issuing from the various CPU cores and executing in the various CXUs.

<<composed-system>> illustrates this. A _Composer_ EDA tool assembles
and configures the reusable, composable CPU and CXU RTL packages into
a complete system, per the system manifest, and generates a devicetree
(or similar) that determines the system CXU map. Each extension library
uses the CX Runtime to select its respective composable extension, and
its CXU, prior to issuing custom function instructions of that extension
to that CXU.

=== Scope: reliable composition via strict isolation

To ensure that composition of composable extensions and their CXUs does
not subtly change the behavior of any extension, each must operate in
isolation. Therefore, each custom function (CF) instruction is of limited
scope: exclusively computing an ALU-like integer function of up to two
operands (integer register(s) and/or immediate value), with read/write
access to the extension's private state (if any), writing the result to
a destination register.

A CF may access the CX's custom CSRs (CX CSRs).

A CF may not access other resources, such as floating-point registers
or vector registers, pending definition of suitable custom instruction
formats.

A CF may not access _isolation-problematic_ shared resources such as
memory, standard CSRs, the program counter, the instruction stream,
exceptions, or interrupts, pending a means to ensure correct composition
by design. (Except that, as with RISC-V floating point extensions,
the error model accumulates CX custom operation errors in a shared CX
status standard CSR.)

[TIP]
====
The isolated state of a composable extension can include private registers
and private memories.
====

[TIP]
====
CX CSRs provide a uniform, conflict-free way to provide, and access,
per CX custom CSRs.
====

==== Stateless and stateful composable extensions

A composable extension may be stateless or stateful. For a stateless
extension, each CF is a pure function of its operands, whereas a stateful
extension has one or more isolated state contexts, and each CF may access,
and as a side effect, update, the hart's _current_ state context of the
extension (only).

Isolated state means that latency notwithstanding, 1) the behavior of
the extension only depends upon the series of CF requests issued on that
extension, and of CX CSR accesses to that extension, and never upon on any
other operation of the system; and 2) besides updating extension state,
the CX status CSR, and a destination register, issuing a CF has no effect
upon any other architected state or behavior of the system. Issuing a CF
instruction or accessing a CX CSR may update the current state context
of the composable extension but has no effect upon another state context
of that extension, nor that of any other extension.

A CXU implementing a stateful composable extension is typically provisioned
with one state context per hart, but other configurations, including
one context per request, activity, fiber, task, or thread, or a small
pool of shared contexts, or several harts sharing one context, or one
singleton context, are also possible. Similarly, each CXU in a system
may be configured with a different number of its state contexts.

All stateful composable extensions are <<serializable,_serializable_>>
and support uniform (extension-agnostic) CX state context
save/restore/management.

[TIP]
====
CX CSRs provide access to control and status of a stateful composable
extension. A stateful CX may also have other isolated state that is not
architecturally visible, but which nevertheless determines the behavior
and results of the CX's CF instructions and custom CSRs.
====

=== Standard extensions and formats

To facilitate an open ecosystem of composable extensions, CXUs,
libraries, and tools, the specification defines common interop extensions
and formats:

* _CX-ISA_, the _Composable Extensions' ISA Extension,_
* _CX-API_, the _Composable Extensions' Application Programming Interface,_
* _CX-ABI_, the _Composable Extensions' Application Binary Interface,_
* _CXU-LI_, the _CXU Logic Interface_,
* _CXU-MD_, build-time _CXU Metadata._

[[layers]]

image::composition-layers.png[image,width=400]

The hardware-software extensions stack (<<layers>>) shows how these
extensions and formats work together to compose user-defined composable
extensions CX~0~ and CX~1~, their libraries, and their CXUs into a system.

==== CXU Logic Interface (CXU-LI)

The CXU-LI defines the hardware-to-hardware logic extension between a
_CXU requester_ (e.g., a CPU) and a _CXU responder_ (e.g., a CXU). When
a custom function instruction issues, the CPU sends a _CXU request_,
providing the request's _CXU identifier (<<CXU_ID,CXU_ID>>)_,
the _function identifier (<<FUNC_ID,FUNC_ID>>), _state index
(<<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>>)_, if any, and request data (operands). The
CXU performs the function then sends a _CXU response_ providing
response data and error status.

In a system with multiple CPUs and/or CXUs, switch and adapter CXUs
accept and route requests to CXUs and accept and route responses back
to CPUs. The CXU-LI supports CPUs and CXUs of various _feature levels_
of capability and complexity, including combinational CXUs, fixed-latency
CXUs, and variable latency CXUs with flow control.

[[intro-CSRs]]
==== CX-ISA: composable extensions' ISA extension

The CX-ISA "composable extensions" extension adds four new standard CSRs
(and zero new instructions), that provide access-controlled composable
extension multiplexing and error signaling. These CSRs modify the behavior
of `custom-[012]` instructions cite:[risc-v-unpriv(143)] and custom
address CSRs, to compose, conflict-free, with other composable extensions
and with any built-in custom extensions. The four new CXU CSRs are:

* `mcx_selector`: selects the hart's current <<CXU_ID,CXU_ID>> and
<<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>>, for composable extension multiplexing;

* `cx_status`: accumulates CXU errors;

* `mcx_table`, `cx_index`: efficient access control to CXUs and CXU state.

[NOTE]
====
The machine mode `mcx_table` CSR is probably insufficient for processors
with hypervisor privilege levels. This will require additional spec
design work and additional CX-ISA CSRs.
====

[[Intro-CXM]]
==== Composable extension multiplexing

Composable extension multiplexing provides inexhaustible collision-free
custom instruction opcodes and custom CSR addresses, for diverse
composable extensions, without resort to any _central assigned opcodes
authority_, and thereby facilitates direct reuse of CX library binaries.

A custom-extension-aware library, prior to issuing a CF instruction,
must first CSR-write a _system and hart specific_ CX selector value to
`mcx_selector`, routing subsequently issued CF instructions on this
hart to its CXU and to a specific state context. Like the -V vector
extension's `vsetvl` instructions, a CSR-write to `mcx_selector` is a
prefix that modifies the behavior of CF instructions that follow. With
each CF instruction issued, the CPU sends a CXU request to the hart's
current CXU and its current state. This request is routed by standard
switch and adapter CXUs to the hart's _current_ CXU, which performs
the custom function using the hart's current state context. Its response
is routed back to the CPU which writes the destination register and
updates `cxu_status`.

The `mcx_selector` CX selector value, a tuple (<<CXU_ID,CXU_ID>>,
<<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>>), is system specific because different systems may
be configured with different sets of CXUs, with different CXU_ID mappings,
and is hart specific because different harts may use different isolated
state contexts. Raw CX selector values are not typically compiled into
software binaries.

In a system with multiple CX libraries that invoke CF instructions
on different extensions, each library uses the CX Runtime to look up
selectors for a CX_ID and update `mcx_selector`, routing CF instructions
to its extension's CXU and state context. Over time, across library calls,
`mcx_selector` is written again and again.

[TIP]
====
Reuse of custom instruction encodings across extensions will make
debugging, esp. disassembly, more challenging.
====

The `mcx_selector` also incorporates a _custom operation trap enable_
(`cte`). When set, custom instructions and accesses to custom CSRs
raise an illegal instruction exception. This enables software emulation
of absent custom instructions, software emulation of absent composable
extensions, and transparent virtualization of stateful composable
extensions.

==== `IStateContext` and serializable stateful composable extensions

The specification defines a composable extension `IStateContext` with four
standard custom functions for serializable stateful composable extensions:

[source,C++]
....
extension IStateContext {
//  CF_ID       custom function
    [1023] int  cf_read_status ();
    [1022] void cf_write_status(int status);
    [1021] int  cf_read_state  (int index);
    [1020] void cf_write_state (int index, int state);
};
....

The CXU status indicates cumulative error flags, clean/dirty, and state
context size. The read/write state functions access words of the state
context.

These standard custom functions enable an extension-aware CX library to
access stateful extension specific error status, and an extension-agnostic
runtime or operating system to reset, save, and reload state context(s).

==== CX-API (Application Programming Interface) and CX-ABI (Application Binary Interface)

Together the CX-API (the _CX Runtime_ API) and CX-ABI provide the programming
model used by composable extension libraries.

Both are necessary for correct discovery, operation, and composition
of CX libraries. As described above (<<intro-CSRs>>) the current `mcx_selector`
CSR selects the current composable extension/CXU and state context for the
hart. However, a CX library should not directly create a CX selector
value, nor directly access the CSR. Rather a CX library uses the CX
Runtime to look up the CX selector value for its composable extension's
CX_ID and to write it to `mcx_selector`, prior to issuing CF
instructions. For example,

[source,C++]
....
#include "cx.h"                         // CX Runtime: class use_cx { ... }
..
use_cx cx(CX_ID_IBitmanip);             // csrrw mcx_selector
uint32_t count = cf(pcnt_cf, data, 0);  // cx_reg cf_id, rd, rs1, rs2
....

The CX-ABI defines the calling convention for managing the `mcx_selector` CSR.

Its design follows these tenets and (competing) goals:

1. Support composition of CX libraries, including nested composition of CX libraries, alongside legacy custom extension libraries.
2. Support preexisting legacy custom extension libraries, even when they don't explicitly manage (disable) CX muxing.
3. Minimize the CX selection "trust surface" to that of the current function (or perhaps, current library).
4. Minimize the number of CX selector writes.

Therefore for maximum preexisting legacy custom extension library
compatibility and maximum paranoia (least trust of other code), the
CX-ABI keeps CX muxing off across function calls, only enabling CX muxing
and selecting a CX and CX state context immediately prior to issuing
that CX's custom instructions.

The CX-ABI defines these five rules, which must be implemented explicitly
in code or automatically by CX-ABI aware compilers:

1. *[ABI-INIT]*: Initially, the selection is legacy mode.

2. *[ABI-ENTRY]*: On entry to a function, or following a function call,
the selection is legacy mode.

3. *[ABI-SELECT-CX]*: Code *must* select a CX prior to issuing that CX's
custom operations.

4. *[ABI-DESELECT-CX]*: Code that selects a CX *must* select legacy
mode prior to calling a function, returning, or stack unwinding.

5. *[ABI-SELECT-LEGACY]*: Code *should* select legacy mode prior to issuing
built-in custom operations.

This is discussed in more detail in the CX-ABI chapter.

=== System composition

==== Metadata and system manifest

To support automatic composition of CPUs and CXUs into working systems,
this specification defines a standard CXU metadata format that details
each core's properties, features, and configurable parameters, including
CXU-LI feature level, data widths, response latency (or variable),
and number of state contexts. Each CPU and CXU package, as well as the
system manifest, include a metadata file.

==== Composer

A system composer (human or tool) gathers the system manifest metadata and
the metadata of the manifest-specified CPUs and CXUs, then uses (manual
or automatic) constraint satisfaction to find feasible, optimal parameter
settings across these components. The composer may also configure or
generate switch and adapter CXUs to automatically interconnect the CPU and
the CXUs.

For example, a system composed from a CPU that supports two or three
cycle fixed latency CXUs, a CXU~1~ that supports response latency
of one or more cycles, a CXU~2~ that has a fixed response latency of
three cycles, and CXU~3~ which is combinational (zero cycles latency),
overall has a valid configuration with three cycles of CXU latency,
with the CPU coupled to a switch CXU, coupled to CXU~1~ and CXU~2~ and to
a _fixed latency adapter CXU_, coupled to CXU~3~.

==== Diversity of systems and operating systems

Composable extensions and CXUs are designed for use across a broad
spectrum of RISC-V systems, from a simple RVI20U (+CX-ISA) microcontroller
running bare metal fully trusted firmware, to a multicore RVA20S Linux
profile, running secure multi-programmed, multithreaded user processes
running various CX libraries, and with privileged hypervisors and
operating systems securely managing access control to CXUs and CXU state.

[[versioning]]
=== Versioning

Interoperation specifications live for decades. Meanwhile "the only
constant is change". This specification anticipates various axes of
versioning.

* Specification versioning. This specification and its requirements
will evolve. The extensions and formats it specifies will evolve. This
includes the CXU Logic Interface, for example.

* CXU-LI versioning. The CXU hardware-hardware extension spec will evolve,
with new signals, behaviors, constraints, metadata.

* Composable extension versioning. Any user-defined composable extension
may evolve, changing or adding custom functions, changing behaviors,
semantics.

* Component implementation versioning. Without changing the extensions
it implements, the implementation of a component such as a CXU, CPU,
or a CX library may change for a bug fix, a performance enhancement,
or any other reason..

How are these anticipated and addressed?

CXU-LI versioning: A CXU module configuration parameter `CXU_LI_VERSION`
indicates to the CXU the version of the CXU-LI signals and semantics
in effect.

Versioning of the extension multiplexing mechanism:
The `mcx_selector.version` field determines the current extension
multiplexing version. It provides backwards compatibility with legacy custom
instructions (i.e., multiplexing _off_) and forwards compatibility with
future extension multiplexing schemes, anticipating future layouts and
interpretations of other selector fields and future means of decoding
`custom-[0123]` instructions into CXU requests.

Composable extension versioning: A composable extension is immutable. To
change or add any custom functions or their behaviors, a new composable
extension must be minted. (Consider the many AVX vector extensions
variants have been introduced over many years.) With Microsoft
COM software components, an extension `IFoo` might evolve to become
`IFoo2`. The original `IFoo` remains and `IFoo` clients are unaffected.
But every component implements `IUnknown::QueryInterface()`, to determine
if the component implements a given extension. A component might implement
both extensions, giving its client a choice.

Similarly a CXU might implement two composable extensions, e.g. `IPosit`, and
`IPosit2`, an enhanced version of `IPosit` introduced later. In that case,
the CXU will have two CXU IDs, `CXU_CXU_ID_MAX=2`, one for each extension
it implements, each present in the CXU Map, from `CX_ID_IPosit` to the
first CXU ID and `CX_ID_IPosit2` to the second. Thus each CX software
library present can access the extension, functions, and behavior it
depends upon, even if only one CXU module implements both behaviors.

Note how composable extension multiplexing facilitates extension versioning:
a new version of an extension (i.e., a new extension) may be introduced
at no cost to any existing or future extension.

Implementation versioning: This does not change the extension to a
component (e.g.. for a CXU, its CXU-LI and the composable extension it
implements). At system composition time it may be necessary to specify
implementation version requirements, perhaps in metadata, but this
should not be visible to, computed upon, nor depended upon, the
HW-HW-SW interfaces.

[NOTE]
====
TODO: Add examples of Alice and Bob's travails with their composed SoC
designs, over time.
====

All version numbering uses semantic versioning https://semver.org.

=== Pushing the envelope

The hardware-hardware and hardware-software extensions proposed in this
draft specification are a foundational step, necessary but insufficient
to fully achieve the modular, automatically interoperable extension
ecosystem we envision.

A complete solution probably entails much new work, for example in runtime
libraries, language support, tools (binary tools, debuggers, profilers,
instrumentation), emulators, resource managers including operating systems
and hypervisors, and tests and test infrastructure including formal
systems to specify and validate composable extensions and their CXU
implementations.

Whether or not the specific abstractions and interoperation extensions
proposed herein are adopted, we believe this specification motivates
composable extension composition, and illustrates _one approach_ for such
composition scenarios using RISC-V, in sufficient detail to understand
how the moving pieces achieve a workable composition system, and to
spotlight some of the issues that arise.

ifdef::notdef[]
[NOTE]
====
Consider global renaming: composable extension to composable extension (CX);
composable extension library to CX library; and CXU to CXU. Then we would
have _CX libs target CXs_ and _CXUs implement CXs_.
====
endif::notdef[]

=== Future directions, TODOs

The present specification focuses on composition at the hardware-software
extension, and below. Future work includes:

* Expand the scope of composable extensions to include access to non-integer
registers, CSRs, and memory, while preserving composition.

* Expand the CXU Logic Interface to support greater computation
flexibility and speculative execution.

* Design and implement an automatic system composition tool.
