== CX-ABI: CX Application Binary Interface

=== Basic ABI
Each thread has a current CX selection that determines how custom
instructions and custom CSR accesses ("custom operations") are
performed. The current selection may be:

1. Legacy mode: CX multiplexing is _disabled_: custom operations issue
pre-existing built-in custom operations.

2. CX mode: CX multiplexing is _enabled_: custom operations issue to
the selected CX and CX state context.

The CX-ABI defines these rules, which must be implemented explicitly
in code or automatically by CX-ABI aware compilers:

1. *[ABI-INIT]*: Initially, the selection is legacy mode.

2. *[ABI-ENTRY]*: On entry to a function, or following a function call,
the selection is legacy mode.

3. *[ABI-SELECT-CX]*: Code *must* select a CX prior to issuing that CX's
custom operations.

4. *[ABI-DESELECT-CX]*: Code that selects a CX *must* select legacy
mode prior to calling a function, returning, or stack unwinding.

5. *[ABI-SELECT-LEGACY]*: Code *should* select legacy mode prior to issuing
built-in custom operations.

=== ABI with CX functions -- provisional

[TIP]
====
This provisional ABI section is non-normative.

At present there is a proposal to designate certain functions as _CX functions_
which *must* be called in CX mode, with selected CX and state context.

Therefore for this "CX-ABI with CX functions" there are two types of functions:

1. Ordinary functions. Ordinary functions expect legacy mode.

2. CX functions. CX functions are so-designated by a language-specific
attribute, declaration, or type specifier. CX functions require CX mode.

This provisional ABI defines these rules, which must be implemented
explicitly in code or automatically by CX-ABI aware compilers:

1. *[ABI-INIT]*: Initially, the selection is legacy mode.

2. *[ABI-ENTRY]*: On entry to an _ordinary_ function, or following _any_
function call, the selection is legacy mode.

3. *[ABI-CX-ENTRY]*: On entry to a _CX_ function, the selection is CX mode.

4. *[ABI-SELECT-CX]*: Code *must* select a CX prior to issuing that CX's
custom operations _or calling a CX function_.

5. *[ABI-DESELECT-CX]*: Code that selects a CX *must* select legacy
mode prior to calling an _ordinary_ function, returning, or stack unwinding.

6. *[ABI-SELECT-LEGACY]*: Code *should* select legacy mode prior to issuing
built-in custom operations.

=== Rationale
[TIP]
====
This Rationale section is non-normative.
====

The CX ABI ensures correct composition of independently authored CX
libraries and legacy custom extension libraries under CX multiplexing.

CX multiplexing operates by setting the hart's CX selector (`mcx_selector`
write), or setting it indirectly (`cx_index` write), to select a specific
CX and CX state context to issue custom instructions or accessing
custom CSRs (together, "custom operations"). 

Per §<<mcx_selector>>, `mcx_selector.version` determines whether CX
multiplexing is enabled or disabled:

* "When `version=0`, disable composable extension multiplexing. ...
`Custom-[0123]` instructions execute the CPU's built-in custom instructions."

* "When `version=1`, enable ... composable extension multiplexing. ...
`Custom-[012]` instructions issue CXU requests to the CXU
identified by `cxu_id` and to the state context identified by `state_id`."

So software must write the CX selector prior to issuing CX custom
operations, and software must also ensure the CX selector is disabled
prior to issuing legacy custom operations.

Since application software is composed of dozens or hundreds of
separately authored, sometimes separately versioned libraries, we require
an application binary interface (ABI) that ensures dependable disciplined
use of the thread's shared CX selector, so that whenever software performs
custom operations, these are performed against exactly the expected CX
or legacy custom.

==== Callee-save won't do
An older version of the spec defined a provisional CX ABI that managed
the CX selector with a _callee-save_ discipline:

1. Initial selection is legacy mode.

2. Any code that writes CX selector must save the prior value and restore it upon return / stack unwind.

3. Code which does not change selectors need not save or restore selectors.

This callee-save discipline has the advantages that:

* It provides correct nested composition of CX libraries.

** If CX A lib selects CX A, performs A custom operations then calls
lib B, which selects CX B and performs B custom operations, B must
re-select the previous selection (CX A) prior to returning to lib A,
which can then happily perform more A custom operations.

* Compared to _caller-save_, wherein a CX library defensively re-selects
its CX after every function call out, the CX library trusts the transitive
callees to restore its CX selection, minimizing the number
of CX selector writes in a given code path.

What's wrong with callee-save?

_It breaks legacy custom code._ Under callee-save you must always select
your CX (or legacy mode) prior to issuing custom operations. However
preexisting legacy custom code, and legacy compilers, both predating CX,
do not include the required CX selector writes to select legacy mode,
nor a matching CX selector write to restore the caller's selection. So
any explicit or implicit use of a legacy custom operation may instead
forward to some other selected CX -- a disaster! In summary, callee-save
discipline is incompatible in general with legacy libraries and compilers
that use legacy custom operations at will. Since legacy custom code may
appear almost anywhere, it follows the default, ambient CX selection
should be legacy mode.

_Wrong trust model._ Callee-save CX selection means you must trust code
you do not control to preserve your current CX selection. In general any
C function capable ABI assumes that a callee will not corrupt the stack or
do other undefined behavior that corrupts the caller, but CX multiplexing
is a sharp knife, and if the callee violates the callee-save ABI and
returns with a different CX selector in place, the caller may issue
custom operations to the wrong CX or CX state context. In applications
comprising separately authored, separately versioned libraries, it is
not possible to inspect the transitive call graph from a CX library to
ensure callers preserve the CX selection as required. A more secure,
more defensive, more amenable to program analysis ABI merits a greater
degree of paranoia in each CX library, by assuming that callees do not
preserve the current CX selection.

==== Ambient legacy mode ABI

These two problems with callee-save discipline led to a redesign of the
ABI. The revised design tenets are:

1. Support composition of CX libraries, including nested composition of
CX libraries, alongside legacy custom extension libraries.

2. Support preexisting legacy custom extension libraries, even when they
don't explicitly manage (disable) CX muxing.

3. Minimize the CX selection "trust surface" to that of the current
function (or perhaps, current library).

4. Minimize the number of CX selector writes.

The present ABI endeavors to maintain an ambient legacy mode selection when
not actively issuing CX custom operations. This ensures, to the greatest
extent possible, that legacy custom code, unaware of CX multiplexing,
and lacking the code to select legacy custom mode, nevertheless always
operates in legacy custom mode.

For CX libraries, this code supports composition and nested
composition. Composition works because each library
selects its CX prior to issuing its custom operations. Nested composition
also works, because, after following a function call (*[ABI-ENTRY]*)
the caller must re-select its CX (*[ABI-SELECT-CX]*)
prior to issuing additional custom operations:

    CX A lib sets CX selection to CX A, issues A operations
    CX A lib sets CX selection to legacy mode, calls CX B lib
    CX B lib sets CX selection to CX B, issues B operations
    CX B lib sets CX selection to legacy mode, returns
    CX A lib sets CX select to CX A, issues more A operations
    CX A lib sets CX selection to legacy mode, returns.

Also, all is well when a CX A lib calls legacy custom code:

    CX A lib sets CX selection to CX A, issues A operations
    CX A lib sets CX selection to legacy mode, calls legacy lib
    legacy lib issues its legacy custom operations
    legacy lib returns
    CX A lib sets CX select to CX A, issues more A operations
    CX A lib sets CX selection to legacy mode, returns.

Rule *[ABI-DESELECT-CX]* helps ensure that following a brief excursion into
a CX lib which changes the CX selection, we immediately return to legacy
mode in case we encounter selection-less legacy custom code.

There is still an attack surface caused by malicious code violating the
ABI by selecting some CX, then calling (or returning to) selection-less
legacy custom code, which issues custom operations which are not the
legacy custom operations it intends causing unboundedly undefined
behavior.

Rule *[ABI-SELECT-LEGACY]* helps defend against this. To the extent
practical or necessary, legacy custom code should be compiled defensively
to set legacy mode on entry and after function calls prior to issuing
its custom operations.

Unlike the deprecated callee-save ABI, these rules will incur
additional unnecessary CX selection writes and will give up a little
bit of performance (which after all may be the reason for using that
CX in the first place.) For example, in the CX A lib + CX B lib nested
example above, several CX selector writes are unnecessary. It is possible
for a CX enlightened compiler+linker to analyze control flow within a
monolithic CX library and optimize the generated code by eliding provably
unnecessary defensive CX selector writes.
